# Memento of Michael Guidry

The repository contains different materials related to Michael Guidry, a.k.a. phifli.

- `mirror` contains a mirror of a [Telegraph article](https://telegra.ph/Michael-Guidry-11-08) about phifli,
- `markdown` contains the article translated, and converted to markdown and pandoc'ed html,
- `ftp` contains related stuff found on `210.68.231.37`. I think it is the same material as described in the mentioned article.

## Notes

- the oldest version of [phifli's homepage](http://mikeguidry.net/) found in [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) is dated on December 1, 2023. Weird.
- at the time of writing the last phifli's activity on Github is on August 13, 2019. What happened after that date?

If you happen to know more, just reach me out. I am simply curious.
