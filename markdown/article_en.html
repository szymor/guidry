<p><a href="https://t.me/good_evening">good evening</a>, November 08,
2017</p>
<h2 id="zero-day-attacks..">Zero-Day Attacks..</h2>
<p>Between 1998 and 2000, a series of DDoS attacks targeted websites of
well-known companies and government organizations (e.g., eBay, CNN,
Amazon, FBI, MSN, Yahoo).</p>
<p>The software used for these attacks can now be found by searching for
trinoo (Trin00), TFN (Tribe Flood Network), TFN2K (a more advanced
version), Stacheldraht (German for "barbed wire").</p>
<p>One of the organizers of the attack was the developer of trinoo, a
13-15-year-old hacker named Michael Guidry, known by the pseudonym
phifli (he also uses mikeguidry, mikeg504, but phifli seems to have
stuck with him for life).</p>
<h2 id="and-their-consequences">.. and their consequences</h2>
<p>Attacks on such serious organizations naturally did not go unnoticed
by the FBI. Stories vary greatly from one narrator to another, which is
not surprising: some materials may be classified, everyone has a
subjective view, etc.</p>
<p>For example, one well-known hacker, Mafiaboy (although his reputation
is questionable), released a <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Mafiaboy-Portrait-Hacker-Young-Man/dp/0762770554">book</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mafiaboy: A Portrait of the Hacker as a Young Man</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It contains at least a small piece about Michael:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Phifli (AKA Mikey) - A serious coder, Phifli didn't bother with the
battles; he was all about writing code. At my urging, he would go on to
write Trinoo, a denial-of-service tool that was a key inspiration to me
when I began working toward my series of major attacks. Although he
didn't engage in battle, Phifli loved talking over channels. And he was
kind enough to let his fellow TNT members test out his tools. That gave
us a big advantage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During my research, I came across the following comment (can be found
on <a
href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:mvJC71UWDtUJ:https://www.amazon.com/Mafiaboy-Cracked-Internet-Still-Broken/dp/0670067482+&amp;cd=13&amp;hl=ru&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ru">this</a>
page by searching for phifli) to this book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was an actual member of <code>tnt/phorce</code> and I recall things
VERY differently. MB asked others to help him packet the sites that were
mentioned in the news, and most of them said F' off. Mafiaboy wrote no
tools at all, most of any attack programs were written by phifli,
sinkhole and a few select others. He did use a semi-public scanner to
‘own' machines (solaris boxes, irix) and just either put bots on them,
or used them with trinoo. Before trinoo, he simply logged into a bunch
of machines and manually <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smurf_attack">smurf'd</a> or UDP
flooded targets.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think he just wrote this because nobody wants to hire him, and he
wanted to make money off of other people's accomplishments. What's sad
is he made money off the following people:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ShadowKnight, phifli, dreamwalk, sinkhole, CORE (group), conflict
(group), madcrew (group), NoName (group), chrome (group)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>.. And countless others. By attacking all of those sites, he
initially was the result of many people just giving it up (ie: phifli,
dreamwalk, myself) because he attracted unwanted attention to the scene.
I'm pretty sure Mshadow was the one who leaked the logs of him attacking
the sites to the RCMP/FBI and that's what got him busted. There is much
hatred towards him for this book, him attacking corporate companies. I
showed this book to someone who was around at the same and his jaw
dropped as the BS that is in this book.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, the media portrays MB as some superhacker. HAH. Far from it,
he's a victim of the public's stupidity.</p>

you can learn a bit more about how the attack was carried out
technically.</p>
<p>In any case, all the stories differ somewhat from source to source,
and even this text is just an average of what was found over a couple of
days.</p>
<h2 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h2>
<p>On 06.11.17 at 17:14 MSK, a post appeared on the <a
href="https://t.me/aiWeipeighah7vufoHa0ieToipooYe">FTP channel of a bot
scanner in Telegram</a> with the following content:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img1.png" alt="image1" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The most interesting ones were, of course:</p>
<ul>
<li>anti_mass_surveillance_proof_of_concept.tbz2</li>
<li>bypassing_signal_intelligence_platforms.pdf</li>
<li>congress_fax_9_22_17.pdf</li>
<li>invisible_friends_9-16-17.pdf</li>
<li>systembackup.tar.gz</li>
</ul>
<p>Opening the first one (<a
href="http://mikeguidry.net/releases/congress_complaint_april_2017.pdf">congress_fax</a>),
I skimmed through the text and, somewhat puzzled, clicked on the link at
the bottom of the page: http://mikeguidry.net/releases/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>documents released relating to human/civil rights violations in my
life, and some vulnerabilities relating to mass surveillance, and a few
other things..</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="excavations">Excavations</h2>
<p>Later it turned out that the domains easystyle.org and limittech.net
also lead to this server.</p>
<p>The first one is only found in Michael's PDF files, the second one
Michael used most often for contact email (mike@easystyle.org,
previously phifli@yahoo.com). The latter is mentioned very little, but I
managed to find information from the page header, which suggests that
Michael apparently intended to sell custom exploits. At the time of
writing this post, unfortunately, I can't find a proof link.</p>
<p>In the /releases/ directory on each of the domains, there is a set of
PDF files compiled by Michael at different times over the past two
years. Some are reflections on cybersecurity, some are paranoid musings
about mass surveillance (e.g. <a
href="http://mikeguidry.net/releases/dying_prism.pdf">PRISM</a>).</p>
<p>Briefly summarizing what Michael himself described - in his opinion,
he has been persecuted for the last 20 years, raped (!) about 50 (!)
times, with the last one being this year.</p>
<p>In addition, he constantly talks about drugs being added to his
drinks and food wherever he is. Because of this, it's hard for him to
live, and each time the dose, in his opinion, increases.</p>
<p>Another thing that often appears in his writings is the theft of his
intellectual property by some billion-dollar companies. Unfortunately,
nothing specific could be extracted, so finding out what this software
is and whether it actually exists is quite a challenge.</p>
<p>Besides this, I ran a DirBuster on the server, which allowed me to
find out not only about the uninteresting /link/ and /ks/, but also
about a suddenly very informative letter from Michael to his family. It
can be found <a href="http://mikeguidry.net/a.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>It's worth reading this letter because it has everything to
understand what is happening/has happened in Michael's life and his
current situation. In addition, a fairly detailed story with
descriptions of his travels can be found in <a
href="http://mikeguidry.net/releases/new_complaint.pdf">one</a> of the
PDF files.</p>
<p>The most recent document available on Mike's site is <a
href="http://mikeguidry.net/releases/bypassing_signal_intelligence_platforms.pdf">bypassing_signal_intelligence_platforms.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>It contains reflections on modern surveillance, how to counter it,
etc.</p>
<h2 id="surveillance-antisurveillance">Surveillance,
#AntiSurveillance</h2>
<p>The thought of global surveillance obviously no longer leaves
Michael's mind, as can be judged from his notes/letters and his Twitter:
https://twitter.com/phifli/</p>
<p>Recent posts from there:</p>

<p>Recently, Michael has been developing a sort of "surveillance killer"
(<a
href="https://github.com/mikeguidry/clockwork/tree/antisurveillance">github</a>).
As far as I could understand from everything I've learned during this
time, he wants to fight both total control and hackers on the internet
(?). If his statements are to be believed, he is ready to put his
development into action. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to understand
the principle of operation or read the code, and reading someone else's
(albeit undoubtedly high-quality) C++ code is quite a challenging
task.</p>
<p>The site and documents were just the first find (the second after
finding that FTP server, which has nothing else interesting).</p>
<p>Here are a few unsorted links that I saved for myself during the
search; these could be blog pages with mentions or messages from phifli
or something else:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://myspace.com/phifli/</li>
<li>http://prism.euwatch.eu/2437597877.html</li>

<li>https://publicdbhost.dmca.gripe/random/DigitalGangster.com%202016.txt</li>
<li>ftp://d.easystyle.org/</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are some data about Michael. However, all this can easily be
found on the internet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lived in Tennessee, LA, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, as well as Dubai,
Australia, Germany, UAE. Currently resides in Miami (presumed address:
Miami 45 SW, 24th Rd, Miami, FL, 33129-1509)</li>
<li>Only the year of birth is reliably known - 1985. The full date might
be 31.07.1985</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-little-bit-about-ftp">a little bit about FTP</h2>
<p>During the preparation of the material, another server appeared on
the FTP channel:</p>

</figure>
<p>And later another one was found there:</p>

<img src="img3.png" alt="image3" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Given this and the fact that Michael intended to act by all possible
means, perhaps this is how he wants to tell everyone about himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The whole point is that since crimes continue to be committed against
me I have decided to release information to cause entire different parts
of this, and other governments to bat their eyebrows. I am absolutely
positive it has worked although I am still being drugged. I will
continue to exponentially increase the stakes while this continues to
take place in my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the very first one - using only open (almost the entire file
system!) data, I found out that there is a user www
(ftp://220.126.225.91/etc/passwd) and that he has an empty password.
This allowed me to connect to the server remotely, but I didn't find
anything particularly interesting there. And due to the legacy state of
the SSH server on this machine, I had to tinker with the connection, and
the command looks like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ssh www@220.126.225.91 -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -c
aes128-cbc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way. Instead of a server, some embedded solution is used,
which is obvious from the contents of the directories. I looked at
ftp://220.126.225.91/etc/hostname and <a
href="http://www.northstarmicro.com/undefined-category/miscellaneous4/at91sam9m10-ekes">googled
it</a>.</p>
<p>Although searches in this direction yielded nothing (besides - what
if he really spreads everything in such a "viral" way?), it was quite
interesting.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In general, this is all I managed to find in one evening.</p>
